# DIffeomorphic-Mapping Operator Learning (DIMON)
We introduce a neural operator framework, named DIffeomorphic Mapping Operator learNing (DIMON), which allows AI to learn geometry-dependent solution operators of different types of PDEs on a wide variety of geometries. Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07250

//Note: Data in example 3 is not included in this link as the heart geometries are patient-specific clinical data. Data in Example 3 can be provided by request to the corresponding authors and potentially after an IRB for sharing data is approved.

## Environments


## Examples
This repository contains three examples: solving the Laplace equation on 2D domains, solving reaction-diffusion equations on 2D annulus, and predicting electrical wave propagation on patient-specific left ventricles.  

To train DIMON, please follow these steps
